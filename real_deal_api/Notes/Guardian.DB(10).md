# Guardian DB
- we use Guardian.DB to track JSON Web Tokens (of authorized accounts) for our REST API project. 
- Guardian.DB is a simple module that hooks into Guardian to prevent playback of tokens.
- Guardians tokens arenot tracked,, the only way to set our token inactive is to set experiation date and wait for that time to arrive.
-  Guardian.DB takes an active role and stores each token in the database, verifying it's present. The token is not valid if it's not in the database. 
- This allows to revoke any tokens generated by guardians, because any token which is not expired, has access to our protected endpoints.
- Follow along for a step-by-step tutorial to learn how to implement Guardian.DB, allowing us to track and revoke tokens in our Elixir REST API project.

# STEPS 
 1. add guardian dependenciens on mix.exs
 2. Set our configuration on the file(config.exs) to use guradian 
 DO this - config :guardian, GuardianDB,
            repo: RealDealApi.Repo,
            schema_name: "guardians_tokens", # which gurdian db is going to create 
            sweep_interval: 60 # any exipry token every 60 minutes will get removed from the database 
            the sweep will run through that table and remove expiry tokens

            - By default on token are set to 28 days unless we revoke them

3. Add command in our supervision tree, in the telemetry.ex file.
