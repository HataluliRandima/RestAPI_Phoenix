# Guardian DB
- we use Guardian.DB to track JSON Web Tokens (of authorized accounts) for our REST API project. 
- Guardian.DB is a simple module that hooks into Guardian to prevent playback of tokens.
- Guardians tokens arenot tracked,, the only way to set our token inactive is to set experiation date and wait for that time to arrive.
-  Guardian.DB takes an active role and stores each token in the database, verifying it's present. The token is not valid if it's not in the database. 
- This allows to revoke any tokens generated by guardians, because any token which is not expired, has access to our protected endpoints.
- Follow along for a step-by-step tutorial to learn how to implement Guardian.DB, allowing us to track and revoke tokens in our Elixir REST API project.
