# In a step-by-step tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of refactoring our Plug action to verify account permissions for updating specific data in our REST API project.  Our Plug action is located in the Account Controller, but we'd like to extend its use to other controllers, such as the User Controller.  We will refactor our account JSON response to include our user JSON data.  Follow along for a step-by-step tutorial to learn how to refactor our Plug to reuse in our Elixir REST API project.
